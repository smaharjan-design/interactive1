         Sony Maharjan is trained as a classical realist.
         She has practiced the technique for more than 10 years.
         Currently she is pursuing her undergraduate degree in
         California College of the Arts (CCA) and exploring different forms
         of visual arts. Her training and practice from classical
         realism gave an invaluable foundation in visual arts and
         the education she is receiving at CCA is helping her to be
         a well-rounded artist. She believes in art as a powerful
         tool in self expression and a catalyst for a social change.</p>
