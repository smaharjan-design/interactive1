                 <p class="paragraph"> Cybercafe is a type of business where computers are provided for accessing the internet, playing games,
                    chatting with friends or doing other computer-related tasks. In most cases, access to the computer and internet is charged based on time.
                    There are many internet cafes located worldwide, and in some countries they are considered the primary form of internet access for people.</br>

                             Windows computers were what were available and were famous in Kathmandu in the 90s. The person in the front desk used to keep track of time.
                             For me, pretty much Explorer, Hotmail and Messengers were what I used to go in the Cafe for. I still
                             remember when my best friend offered me to teach how to use messenger to make new friends. It was a precious memory...

                          When we entered the Internet Cafes in Kathmandu Valley, the experience was like going inside the casinos in Las Vegas. We used to see youngsters the most, who are involved in
                          playing games and chatting with friends. There were no any food or drinks served, just computers and people.
