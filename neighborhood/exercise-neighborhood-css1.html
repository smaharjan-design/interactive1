      <h2>Kathmandu Valley</h2>

    <p><This image was captured after the Earthquake of Nepal in 2015.<br>
        The alley where I grew up was very similar to thisâ€“
        street dogs, burning trash, elder people relaxing at
        the patio are the usual scenes we still get to see today
        as well. The images were captured right after the
        Earthquake of Nepal in 2015.
