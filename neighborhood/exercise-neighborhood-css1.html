      <h5 class="memoir">Memoir from 2015 Earthquake</h5>

      <p class="center-align">

      The Kathmandu Valley is still a home for me. All my relatives
      reside there and the memories from my childhood is still linked
      to that place.
      The Kathmandu Valley has lot of alleys. The alley where I grew
      up was very similar to this--
      street dogs, burning trash, elder people relaxing at
      the patio are the usual scenes we still get to see today.
      All these images were captured right after the
      Earthquake of Nepal in 2015.

      <h2 class="location"> Mall Pokhari </h2>
      <img src="assets/my-image2.jpg" alt="Mall Pokhari" class="image1"/>

       <p>

         Mall Pokhari is a government land that sits behind one of my family houses.
         This scene was captured on April 25, 2015 few hours after the massive
         earthquake that killed more than 9000 people. There were not a massive destruction
         around our area but the imapact was so big we were too scared to go back to our houses.
         We were living like this in the open field for about couple weeks.

       </p>



     <h2 class="location">Outskirts of Kathmandu Valley</h2>
     <img src="assets/my-image3.jpg" alt="Mall Pokhari" class="image2"/>
       <p>
         The villages located at outskirts of Kathmandu valley
         are how they looked at my home town when I was growing up.
         The capital used to look similar to this. So much have
         changed because of growing urbanization.
