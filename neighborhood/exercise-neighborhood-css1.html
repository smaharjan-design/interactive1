   <h5 class="memoir">Memoir from 2015 Earthquake</h5>

      <p class="center-align"><This image was captured after the Earthquake of Nepal in 2015.<br>
      The Kathmandu Valley is still a home for me. All my relatives
      reside there and my memories from my childhood is still linked
      to that place.
      The Kathmandu Valley has lot of alleys. The alley where I grew
      up was very similar to this--
      street dogs, burning trash, elder people relaxing at
      the patio are the usual scenes we still get to see today.
      All these images were captured right after the
      Earthquake of Nepal in 2015.
