      <h2>Kathmandu Valley</h2>

    <p><This image was captured after the Earthquake of Nepal in 2015.<br>
        The Kathmandu Valley is still a home for me. All my relatives<br>
        reside there and my memories from my childhood is still linked
        to that place.<br>
        The Kathmandu Valley has lot of alleys. The alley where I grew<br>
        up was very similar to thisâ€“<br>
        street dogs, burning trash, elder people relaxing at<br>
        the patio are the usual scenes we still get to see today<br>
        as well. All these images were captured right after the<br>
        Earthquake of Nepal in 2015.
