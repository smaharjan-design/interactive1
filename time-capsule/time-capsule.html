                 <p class="paragraph"> Cybercafe is a type of business where computers are provided for accessing the internet, playing games,
                    chatting with friends or doing other computer-related tasks. In most cases, access to the computer and internet is charged based on time.
                    There are many internet cafes located worldwide, and in some countries they are considered the primary form of internet access for people.</br>

                          When we entered the Internet Cafes in Kathmandu Valley, the experience was like going inside the casinos in Las Vegas. We used to see youngsters the most, who are involved in
                          playing games and chatting with friends. There were no any food or drinks served, just computers and people.
